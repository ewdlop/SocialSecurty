Yes, the terms "Boomers," "Millennials," "Gen Z," and "Gen X" are used to describe divisions within society. They categorize people based on their birth years, and these categories often reflect shared cultural experiences, technological influences, and societal shifts. However, it's important to remember that:

* **They are social constructs:** These divisions are created by society, not by inherent biological differences.
* **They are generalizations:** Not everyone within a generation shares the same experiences or beliefs.
* **They can be divisive:** Focusing too much on generational differences can lead to stereotypes and misunderstandings.

So, while they are divisions, they're complex and should be used with awareness of their limitations.
